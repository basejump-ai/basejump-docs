Embeds are the simplest way to integrate the Basejump chat interface directly into your web applications, requiring minimal development expertise. Though embeds are a quick and easy way to get started, you may find that functionality is too limited. For total flexibility and access to more features, we recommend using the [API](/basejump_cloud/api.md) directly.
