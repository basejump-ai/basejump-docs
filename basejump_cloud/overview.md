## Company Mission Statement

Make it easier for everyone, everywhere, to access reliable and trusted data quickly.

## Vision

Our long-term vision can be easily understood by focusing on how the business compares to different levels of data maturity. Our platform is an AI-first data analytics platform. What this means is leveraging data agents and giving them all the tools they need to help everyone in the organization succeed faster than ever before. The 5 levels of data maturity can be used to help understand how our organization will improve and evolve over time:

1. Ad Hoc and Reactive
   a. Our data agent is meeting this need. We aim to have this mostly (over 50%) automated in the next 3 years.
2. Descriptive Reporting (“What happened”)
   a. Our data agent will meet this need in coordination with data analysts. Our data agent will focus on the easier tasks and the more difficult tasks or more intricate dashboards will be handled by the data team.
3. Diagnostic Reporting (“Why did it happen?”)
   a. The data agent will coordinate with the data analytics and data science teams to answer these questions. We will be adding data science capabilities to our data agent soon.
4. Predictive Analytics (“What will happen?”)
   a. The data agent will assist the data science team with these questions leveraging machine learning and statistics to answer these questions.
5. Prescriptive Analytics (“How can we make it happen?”)
   a. This is the most mature tier and difficult to achieve, but also the most impactful. The data agent will assist in creating action plans to coordinate efforts to act on data insights.

## History

_By Andreas Martinson, Co-founder and CEO_

My career as a data professional gave me a front-row seat to how AI will change data analytics in the future and I wanted to help shape that future by starting Basejump AI. I started my career as a data analyst, then became a data scientist and a data science lead. I have worked at enterprise level companies, I was the 3rd employee at a subsidiary created inside an enterprise as a 'startup with millions of instant funding', and also a startup with less than 10 people when I joined. Seeing how users interact with their data at these different company sizes gave me the confidence to start my own company with my co-founder, Joel Funk.

The company was originally called 'DemocratizeDB' since we believed using AI to assist with data analytics will result in a paradigm shift that would democratize data access. This shift will be similar in magnitude to when excel spreadsheets started becoming commonplace. The database is practically inaccessible without some sort of intermediary through the data team, however, in the future individuals will be able to chat with an AI to access information in the database quickly.

The company was rebranded to Basejump AI in 2024. Basejump is short for 'database jump' to express how many new people are essentially going to be 'taking the leap' into the vast amount of information available in company databases that are only available typically through interfaces such as dashboards.

We're confident that as AI abilities continue to progress that AI will assist with every stage of the data maturity cycle and we want to help that future become a reality as soon as possible. As data becomes  both more available and reliable, it will improve the decision making capabilities of companies everywhere.
